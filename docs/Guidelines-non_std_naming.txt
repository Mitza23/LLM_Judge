**Company Java & Spring Boot Coding Guidelines**

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for Java and Spring Boot development within the company.
Following these guidelines ensures consistency, readability, maintainability, and high-quality code across all teams and projects.

**2. General Java Coding Standards**
All classes and method names will be prefixed with "joke\_" string
Example:

```java
public class OrderProcessor {
    private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    public void joke_processOrder(String orderId) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**3. Additional Guidelines**

**3.1 Code Reviews**
Every merge request must be reviewed by at least one team member
Ensure code adheres to these guidelines before approval

**3.2 Documentation**
Use JavaDoc for APIs and public methods of any class besides repositories
Comment only where necessary to explain why, not what. Significant implementation details whose reason is not evident should be documented in the `readme.md`, in the ADR section - Architectural Decision Record
Example:

```java
/**
 * Calculates the total price including discounts and taxes.
 *
 * @param items list of items
 * @return final price
 */
public joke_BigDecimal calculateTotal(List<Item> items) {
    // ...
}
```

**5. Conclusion**
These coding guidelines are designed to promote high-quality, maintainable code in Java and Spring Boot projects.
All developers are expected to follow these standards. Regular audits and code reviews will ensure adherence.
